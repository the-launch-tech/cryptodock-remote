# CryptoDock NodeJS Remote API and DataBuilder

_In Development_

The CryptoDock Remote API and DataBuilder is what it sounds like. An API, and a DataBuilder.

1. DataBuilder. The DataBuilder aggregates data from across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges and normalizes the response objects and naming conventions. This allows for easy use in strategy development and research. This includes Klines, Trades, Tickers, and Products across CoinbasePro and Kucoin. Binance and Kraken are being added.

2. API. The API allows for requests of the locally stored DataBuilder data as well as requests to the various exchanges for current exchange data like orderbook snapshots. The API can be accessed through the CryptoDock Framework (python), the CryptoDock Suite (python), and primarily via the CryptoDock SDK (python) which provides a semantic interface for the API queries. All of these tools are used in strategy development, research, and execution.

## Installation

CryptoDock remote exists in the cloud, and is not publicly accessible.

## Usage

CryptoDock remote exists in the cloud, and is not publicly accessible. The only usage is in the querying of API endpoints by the CryptoDock SDK (python), which requires the installation of the CryptoDock desktop interface.
